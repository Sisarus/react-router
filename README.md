# Router with Bootstrap

## General

This guide will help you set up a router with Bootstrap in your React application. We will be using the react-router-dom library version 6.4.3 for routing and Bootstrap for styling.

## Setup

To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```
npm install
```
## Run
```
npm start
```

This command runs the app in development mode. You can open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.

## Notes for me
Added router

```
npm i react-router-dom@6.4.3
```
